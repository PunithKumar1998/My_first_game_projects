# My_first_game_projects


This is my first small game projects done in an IDE and a python shell 

I'am new to python , as i was learning i made two samll games using an IDE and a python shell,
i'am not good in using an IDE , but still i'am trying to get the hang of it 
and as an IDE iam using "VISUAL STUDIO CODE " it is really good to use it the ui is very cool to use 

NOTE ON THE PROJECTS

These two projects are made for fun
they have been made by importing randon moduel
using while loop and also if loop
