# My learning game projects


This is my first small game projects done in an IDE and a python shell 

I'am new to python , as i was learning i made two samll games using an IDE and a python shell,
i'am not good in using an IDE , but still i'am trying to get the hang of it 
and as an IDE iam using "VISUAL STUDIO CODE " it is really good to use it the ui is very cool to use 

NOTE ON THE PROJECTS

These four projects are made for fun
they have been made by importing randon moduel
using while loop and also if loop 

Email.py 
This is a project where your email is sliced into the username and the domain(the domain may differ)
when the user inputs his/her's email the slicer then slices it the sepreates the username and the domain

tic tac tio.py
This is a small but fun game that can be played with your friends.

number_gessing.py
This is also a fun game where the user has to guess the number that the system is generating this will go on 
unless you quite.

Dice.py
This is simular to a regular dice, this wil generate a random number every time it is thrown.
